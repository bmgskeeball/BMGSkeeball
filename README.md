# Bloomington (BMG) Skeeball League

The Bloomington, Indiana Skeeball League is Indiana's only competitive skeeball league. We play monthly seasons  with teams comprised of 1-5 players. 

Since Season 3, our format is each individual bowls ten frames (90 balls) and their score contributes to a team score. Team with the most points wins the night, against the teams they beat. (So beating all of the teams is equal to the # of teams that played that night.) 

At the end of each season, the top two teams face off for the league championship. Our individual tournament pits anyone who has played during the regular season (and often, randos who show up on tournament day) for the league singles title.

All matches are played at Atlas Ballroom in Bloomington at 730pm on Wednesday nights.
